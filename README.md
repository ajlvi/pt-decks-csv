# pt-decks-csv
A compilation of each published decklist from every single-elimination round at PTs/WCs/MCs/PTs.

### Source

Just about everything comes from mtgtop8; for some of the really really old tournaments I had to go to archived copies of the official coverage site. Some of the corrections came from discussions with the players themselves or from old Duelists.

### Data

The `is_pt` column is 0 for "small" Worlds, Players Tour events, and pandemic-era Arena events; 1 otherwise. The half-PT-size Worlds (2023-present) are considered "small". Most of the other columns are probably self-explanatory.

The following events only have four lists included:

- Pro Tour Columbus 1996 [cut was to top 4]
- Pro Tour Dallas 1996 [only four lists published; I possess 1/4 of the QF lists]
- Worlds 1997 [only four lists published; I possess 1/4 of the QF lists]
- "small" Worlds, 2012pc &mdash; 2020wc [cut was to top 4]
- Mythic Championship III [cut was to top 4]
 
### Known issues as of 20.06.30:

- Olle Rade's 1997 Worlds deck should not have 79 cards, but we don't know where the error is.
- There are roughly twenty other 74s, 76s, and 77s; I don't know of any that are certainly wrong, but it wouldn't surprise me if some were.

### Contact

I'd be happy to field any corrections, future feature requests, etc. either via Twitter [@ajlvi], bsky [@ajlvi.bsky.social] or mtgeloproject@gmail.com.
