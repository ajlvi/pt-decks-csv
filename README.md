# pt-decks-csv
A compilation of each published decklist from every single-elimination round at PTs/WCs/MCs/PTs.

The is_pt column is 0 for "small" Worlds, Players Tour events, and pandemic-era Arena events; 1 otherwise. Most of the other columns are probably self-explanatory.

The following events only have four lists included:<ul>
<li>Pro Tour Columbus 1996 [cut was to top 4]
<li>Pro Tour Dallas 1996 [only four lists published; I possess 1/4 of the QF lists]
<li>Worlds 1997 [only four lists published; I possess 1/4 of the QF lists]
<li>"small" Worlds, 2012pc &mdash; 2020wc [cut was to top 4]
<li>Mythic Championship III [cut was to top 4]
 </ul>
 
Known issues as of 20.06.30:
<ul><li>Olle Rade's 1997 Worlds deck should not have 79 cards, but we don't know where the error is.
<li>There are roughly twenty other 74s, 76s, and 77s; I don't know of any that are certainly wrong, but it wouldn't surprise me if some were.
</ul>

I'd be happy to field any corrections, future feature requests, etc. either via Twitter [@ajlvi] or mtgeloproject@gmail.com.
