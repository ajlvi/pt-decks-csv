# pt-decks-csv
A compilation of each decklist from every single-elimination round at PTs/WCs/MCs/PTs.

The is_pt column is 0 for "small" Worlds and Players Tour events; 1 otherwise.

The following events only have four lists included:
 -Pro Tour Columbus 1996 [cut was to top 4]
 -Pro Tour Dallas 1996 [only four lists published; I possess 1/4 of the QF lists]
 -Worlds 1997 [only four lists published; I possess 1/4 of the QF lists]
 -"small" Worlds, 2012pc -- 2020wc [cut was to top 4]
 -Mythic Championship III [cut was to top 4].

Known issues as of 20.06.30:
 -Olle Rade's 1997 Worlds deck should not have 79 cards, but we don't know where the error is.
 -There are roughly twenty 74s, 76s, and 77s; I don't know of any that are certainly wrong, but it wouldn't surprise me if some were.
 
I'd be happy to field any corrections, future feature requests, etc. either via Twitter [@ajlvi] or mtgeloproject@gmail.com.
